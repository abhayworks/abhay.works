                        <p>Mosayec is a nonprofit whose mission “is to increase the number of K through 12th graders who have access to extracurriculars and youth development programs, particularly disadvantaged youth and those living in poverty.” This mission was informed by the nonprofit’s core belief that “all youth need steady access to fun, learning activities that promote emotional, intellectual and spiritual development.” To help materialize part of their mission, the organization sought to build a digital platform for the sharing, tracking and discovery of extracurricular activities for middle schoolers.</p>

                        <p>My team of five other UX designers was approached by the CEO of Mosayec to conceptualize the aforementioned platform which facilitates access to and awareness of opportunities regardless of socioeconomic status, autonomous exploration of individual interests, reflection on and integration of past activities and a positive sense of group-based belonging and identity. The final concept should be delivered in the form of wireframes and a high-fidelity prototype.</p>

                     <h3>Phase 1 &#47; Understand</h3>
                     <p>Since my team consisted of six members dedicated to UX research and design, we had the luxury of executing several research methods which wouldn’t have been feasible under usual circumstances. The methods included: domain research, competitive analysis, surveys, interviews and co-creation workshops.</p>

                  <div class="content--block">
                     <h4>Exploring the Domain</h4>
                     <p>Kevin and I sought to understand the domain by researching middle school aged kids’ general internet/device usage habits both as a means of uncovering any mental models they may have and to detect any technological paradigm shifts among the identified users. This research was especially useful since the target users’ behavior is known to change rapidly. We also sought to gain at least a rudimentary understanding of their extracurricular involvement as well as interpersonal relationships, considering the platform may include socialization functionality.<br><br>The most compelling findings are highlighted below. </p>

                     <p>Meanwhile, Whitney and Paymon performed a competitive analysis of the top 15 mobile/web platforms which focus on the intellectual and social development of middle school aged kids. The platforms were distributed across four categories: academic sharing platforms, event aggregators, homework tracking and EC/youth events discovery. These categories were of interest because, collectively, they embodied the CEO’s vision of Mosayec.</p>

                           <p>The final step of our data collection process consisted of interviewing students, parents and SMEs (teachers, counselors, coaches, etc.). John, Paymon and I were responsible for formulating the questions, but other team members helped with interviews to expedite the process.</p>
                           <p>We sought to answer six broader questions during our in-depth interviews:</p>
                           <ul class="interviewquestions">
                              <li>The context of how the product (or system, if no current product exists) fits into their lives or work flow: when, why, and how the product is or will be used.</li>
                              <li>Domain knowledge from a user perspective: What do users need to know to do their jobs?</li>
                              <li>Current tasks and activities: both those the current product is required to accomplish and those it doesn’t support.</li>
                              <li>Goals and motivation for using their product.</li>
                              <li>Mental Model: How users think about their jobs and activities, as well as what expectations users have about the product.</li>
                              <li>Problems and frustrations with current products (or an analogous system if no current product exists).</li>
                           </ul>
                        </div>

                              <h4>&#47;&#47;Interstice: Workshop 1</h4>
                              <p>Whitney, Kevin and Ayoub developed content and structure for the co-creation workshop we hosted for a small group of middle school aged kids. The purpose of this workshop was to:
                              <ul>
                                 <li>Introduce 11-14 year olds to design thinking principles through practical examples relevant to their lives and milieu </li>
                                 <li>Discover user needs and validate designs through observation, discussion and co-creational activities</li>
                              </ul>
                              </p>
                              <p>The workshop consisted of four primary components through which we attained our goals:
                              <ul>
                                 <li>Introduction to design thinking</li>
                                 <li>Ice breakers designed to give the UX team a basic understanding of the students’ technological habits</li>
                                 <li>Exercise to apply concepts learned from the introduction</li>
                                 <li>Reflection survey for the UX to team to gauge how to design the next workshop in addition to more specific, standardized app/device usage habits.</li>
                              </ul>
                              </p>
                              <p>We came together at the conclusion of the workshop to discuss our findings and develop insights:
                              <ul>
                                 <li>All students have a penchant for mobile gaming</li>
                                 <li>Extracurricular activity participation is strongly correlated with student interest as well as peer involvement</li>
                                 <li>Students need a tangible sense of achievement</li>
                                 <li>All students have access to a PC or tablet, but some of them do not have a mobile phone</li>
                              </ul>
                              </p>

                           <h4>Decoding the Results</h4>
                           <p>After conducting several rounds of interviews with parents, teachers and coaches and gathering data from the students, Paymon, Kevin and I decoded all the data by affinity mapping. The patterns we uncovered were eventually translated into design principles and user personas. Whitney, John and Ayoub spent time developing the final workshop for the students during our decoding process.</p>

                              <h5>Affinity Mapping</h5>
                              <p>The decoding process began with affinity mapping every data point we collected from the survey and interviews. Our process consisted of condensing every main idea into a sticky note then finding patterns among all disparate data points by grouping them into categories. During this process, we discovered that our data was largely in accordance with the research conducted during the domain exploration. This made it easier to move forward with our findings; otherwise we would need to take additional steps to ensure our data was accurate.</p>

                           <h4>Codifying the Insights</h4>
                           <p>Unearthing key insights from affinity mapping allowed us to create a set of design principles which would serve as a beacon for our design solution. We also developed a problem statement, or a statement which encapsulates the ultimate problem the team should solve. This statement had a sizable influence on the design principles. In order to humanize the insights and help us understand the users’ goals, we further extrapolated the data into personas: one tutor and two types of students.</p>

                              <p><span style="color:blue;">3&#47;</span> <i>Exploratory</i> – The platform should allow students to view activities based on interests and preferences but also allow them to explore new interests.</p>
                              <p><span style="color:blue;">4&#47;</span> <i>All-encompassing</i> – The platform needs to provide students from all socioeconomic backgrounds the opportunity to find extracurricular activities.</p>

Following this exercise, we made low-fidelity wireframes of our sketches and immediately discussed our ideas as a team with the creative director.</p> <p>My initial concept is below.</p>

                     <p>Some aspects of this concept, such as the community functionality, were inspired by Slack. Once a student verifies their enrollment at a specific school, they gain access to their district’s communities (akin to channels in Slack) such as chess club, band, art club, recreational soccer, etc. After a user clicks on a community, they can view all upcoming events in a list which includes a preview of details and create their own event. If the user is interested in an event, they can RSVP, view a list of peers who are attending and make comments which are visible to all participants.</p>

                     <p><b>This concept concentrates on event tracking and discovery based on users’ interest as gauged in the onboarding process.</b></p>

Our strategy for administering these user tests was to create two groups of kids with three kids each. UX team 1 tested one group while UX team 2 tested the other. We switched groups after 15 minutes. The benefit to rapid user testing is that the ascertained insights are more organic since the testers wouldn’t necessarily have as much time to assist users.</p>

                              <p>Following the user tests, much of our time was spent being introduced to and personally experiencing the initial concept proposed by the CEO: a “game” in which users select their activities by way of trading and earning cards. It’s unknown why this concept wasn’t fully introduced to the team earlier in the process.</p>

                              <p>Consensus: the concept was far too complex, even for the UX team. From a usability standpoint, we determined implementing the concept was untenable given that 1) we only had one week left to finish the project and run the concept through the validation/create/iteration process and 2) the concept failed to fulfill the CEO’s own requirements which were brought forth during our first meeting.</p>

As I was responsible for interaction design, my goal was to make the prototype as “life-like” as possible, leaving no equivocation for the developers. It also prevents us from having to rely mostly on annotations, which can easily be misinterpreted.</p>

                        <p>Since there were so many modifications we wanted to make within a small time frame, one challenge we faced was determining which changes should take precedence. This was simply resolved by prioritizing the most complex changes rather than simple ones which could easily be mentioned in the final presentation with little to no misinterpretation.</p>

                        <p>One recommendation I’d make is to keep track of and adapt to fluctuating socioeconomic patterns among middle schoolers given our concept is heavily informed by those factors.</p>
