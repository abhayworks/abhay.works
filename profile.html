						<p class="text-container">I'm a product designer who aspires to work with mission-driven organizations that prioritize ethics and human-centered design.

								<h3>Frequently asked questions&#42;</h3>
								<p class="asterisk">&#42;No one’s directly asked me any of these questions outside an interview yet, but as someone who specializes in anticipating user needs, I feel like these answers may be of immediate interest to whomever considers me.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="question1">
								<p class="question">Q&#58; What types of opportunities are you looking for?</p>
								<p class="answer">A&#58; I'm looking for remote product design positions at nonprofits, universities, and other mission-driven organizations in the US.</p><br>
						    </div>
						    <div class="question2">
								<p class="question">Q&#58; What's your design process?</p>
								<p class="answer">A&#58; My approach, differing only in nomenclature, follows the standard<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-thinking/" target="_blank" class="faq--link"> design thinking process↗</a>. I found it's easier to implement when restructured in a way that makes sense to me. This strategy proves ownership and understanding:
								<ol id="answer--ol">
									<li><strong>Understand</strong>: Empathize with users and define the problem</li>
									<li><strong>Create</strong>: Ideate solutions and develop a design framework with wireframes, mockups and prototypes</li>
									<li><strong>Validate</strong>: Test the design solutions with potential users and return to the Create and/or Understand phases as necessary</li>
								</ol>
								</p><br>
						    </div>
						    <div class="question3">
								<p class="question">Q&#58; Are you a dev too?</p>
								<p class="answer">A&#58; I consider myself proficient enough in front-end development to communicate clearly with a dev team, but not enough to be hired as one. Though, I'm always willing to learn new skills.</p><br>
						    </div>
						    <div class="question4">
								<p class="question">Q&#58; What are your strengths/weaknesses?</p>
								<p class="answer">A&#58; <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/02/7-rules-for-job-interview-questions-that-result-in-great-hires" target="_blank" class="faq--link"> Consider asking better questions↗</a>.</p><br>
						    </div>
						    <div class="question5">
								<p class="question">Q&#58; Why nonprofits, academic institutions, and mission-driven organizations?</p>
								<p class="answer">A&#58; One of my tenets is to harm others as little as possible. With respect to my professional life, this means not working with institutions that perpetuate inequality, human suffering, and environmental destruction. As far as I know, <em>most</em> mission-driven orgs are antithetical to such harm (Though, I could be way off about this. <a href="https://ashesashes.org/blog/episode-75-business-school" target="_blank" class="faq--link">Universities aren't always as noble as one would hope↗</a> and the Nonprofit Industrial Complex <a href="npic.pdf" target="_blank" class="faq--link"> is of growing concern↗</a>).</p><p class="answer">I'm far more interested in practicing UX design for usability's own sake rather than as a means for generating cash flow. That is, I have no interest in designing to collect user data, upsell frivolous things, addict users, or manipulate/exploit users in any other capacity. Nonprofits and other mission-driven organizations are a great place to implement this approach, despite the apprehension I expressed above.</p><br>
						    </div>
						    <div class="question6">
								<p class="question">Q&#58; Do you need US visa sponsorship?</p>
								<p class="answer">A&#58; No. I'm an American citizen and English is my first language. Interview me if you're still doubtful.</p>

								<h3>Opinions</h3>
								<p class="answer">"There is one thing specific that Abhay has been bringing to the table over the past 6 months, and that is measuring design. The team hasn't made the jump to apply any specific metrics, but Abhay's recommendations of the HEART framework, SUS, Standards inspection, Research Maturity Scale, and the massive list he produced in our brainstorming session has really open my eyes to how we can start to prove good design. It's one thing to say we're a strong team, but now we can start to prove it." -Product Design Team Lead, July 2021</p><br>
								<p class="answer">"Abhay is my go-to person for everything usability testing and survey related. He has a knack for wording user questions in a way that is not leading. I think this is the hardest part of writing a user survey or creating usability questions, and I've made a point of always reaching out to Abhay for his review on these. He is very articulate in planning and although quiet, his feedback and input is always well-thought out. He asks a lot of questions which is a very important aspect of research-focused design. In the time I've known Abhay, he's become more outgoing and I feel he's become more comfortable speaking out in group settings." -Product Designer (colleague), July 2021</p><br>
								<p class="answer">"Abhay is extremely thorough in his work towards understanding, exploring, researching, devising, and in the implementation and final wrap up of projects. I appreciate how resourceful he is towards any kind of problem, and how he is always looking at things holistically but also in the minute details. He is very well-spoken and a great communicator within our team internally and towards clients." -Product Designer (colleague), July 2021</p><br>
								<p class="answer">"Abhay is a valuable resource for UX research. I look to him for advice and feedback on usability testing, interviews and user surveys. He is always willing to jump in and review something and/or help out if needed, then give his honest and candid opinion on how you can improve something. He has a solid grasp of best practices in UX. Although often quiet, Abhay will offer insightful observations and feedback when asked. I see him as a very reliable person who is a team player, and doesn't hesitate to jump into a situation, gather context, and take action when necessary. Abhay has played a huge part in pioneering UX processes for the team, and helping spread an understanding of the importance of research in a project. He seems to be very good at context switching between multiple projects as well." -Product Designer (colleague), July 2021</p>
