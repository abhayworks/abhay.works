						  		<h4>Context</h4>
						  		<p>Tandlr is a web-app which enables college students to book sessions with peer tutors who are based in the same university and pass a rigorous screening process. The two co-founders of Tandlr discovered, however, that the web-app alone doesn’t satisfy their users’ needs. Their solution: develop a mobile application to become a stronger competitor in the emerging college tutoring market by improving the accessibility and feature set of Tandlr.</p>
						  </div>
						  <div class="content--block">
						  		<h4>Challenge</h4>
						  		<p>My UX team was approached by Tandlr to improve their mobile concept by way of user testing/interviewing, competitive analysis and redesigning their existing mobile wireframes based on our research, all of which would result in a high-fidelity prototype. The wireframes Tandlr’s CTO gave us, however, didn’t properly communicate the co-founders’ vision of the application: Uber for college tutoring (on-demand 24/7 availability, surge pricing, cheaper than traditional avenues of tutoring, premium, etc.) with the addition of future booking functionality.</p>

							  		<p>Both Eric and I began this phase by evaluating five primary competitors based on six categories while Tori created the user flow and a basic prototype from the existing wireframes.

						  		<p>With the exception of Sesh, which resembles Tandlr’s vision the most, we found that all competitors were nearly identical with respect to features and pricing models; most likely because every market player is still an early stage startup. This would make differentiating much easier than anticipated, especially since Sesh’s feature set is relatively basic. <br><br>Some ways Tandlr could stand out:</p>
						  		<ul class="standout">
						  			<li>Build credibility by creating relationships with universities</li>
						  			<li>Provide 24/7 service</li>
						  			<li>Split payment for group sessions</li>
						  			<li>Highlight transparency on the tutor screening process to build trust with students</li>
						  		</ul>
						  		<p><em>&#42;Note that the last three characteristics align with a few of Uber’s.&#42;</em></p>
						  </div>
						  <div class="content--block">
						  		 <h4>Learning From the Past</h4>
						  		 <p>All three of us completed a heuristic evaluation of the wireframes while also creating the competitive analysis and wireframes/flows. I’ll admit that performing the evaluation felt like an inconsequential task since we knew full well the wireframes needed to be completely redesigned anyway. After further consideration, I realized that following through would help us avoid making the mistakes Tandlr initially made. My observations of the student and tutor flows Tori assembled are noted below.</p>

						  		<h4>Listening to the Users &#47; Part 1</h4>
						  		<p>My team moved on to testing and interviewing potential users of the app after gaining an intimate understanding of the competitive landscape and conceptual groundwork as communicated by the wireframes, but not before addressing a critical problem. As alluded to earlier, we felt the wireframes weren’t in a presentable state, even for initial testing. </p><br>

						  		<div class="content--block" id="conundrum">
						  			<div class="conundrum--content">
						  				<h4>&#47;&#47;The Conundrum</h4>
						  				<p>Do we redesign the wireframes (which were made in PowerPoint, by the way) solely based on the competitive and heuristic analyses so the few users we test can have a slightly better experience or do we save time and test the wireframes as they are, ignoring all minutia we already considered while directing most of our attention on the concept rather than usability? In other words, we had to choose between short and long term gains.</p>
						  		    </div>
						       </div><br>
						       <p>We ultimately decided to proceed with the latter approach since it would yield more useful data. It was at this point my team and I formed questions, predicated on Tandlr’s vision, to ask the potential users. The questions were divided into three categories: High level, Student and Tutor. Some of these questions are highlighted below.</p><br>

						  			<h4>Wireframing</h4>
						  			<p>While Tori and Eric wireframed the rest of the flows, I began prototyping existing concepts produced during Crazy Eights. Their flows included:</p>
						  		
							  		<div class="content--block" id="asideimg">
										<div>
										    <ul>
										    	<li>Accept, cancel, and trade appointments</li>
										    	<li>View upcoming and past appointments</li>

										    	<li>Start a tutoring session and rate the student</li>
										    	<li>Check messages and respond to messages</li>
										    	<li>Check earnings history and add a new checking account</li>
										    	<li>Check notifications and change settings</li>

						  		<h4>Prototyping</h4>
						  		<p>I used my prototyping tool of choice, Proto.io, to recreate the wireframes Tori and Eric produced. This strategy allowed me to accomplish three things simultaneously.</p>
						  		<div class="content--block">
							  		<h6>1&#47; Interactivity</h6>
							  		<p>I was able to make the prototype more interactive, and hence provide a more accurate depiction of how the final product should function, since recreating screens gives ultimate flexibility with each element. Simply importing screens from Sketch and linking them together, in my opinion, doesn’t fully satisfy the purpose of a working prototype.</p>
							  		<h6>2&#47; Redundancy</h6>
							  		<p>Recreating the screens allowed me to fill any conceptual gaps or other errors, which may have been left by my team members.</p>
							  		<h6>3&#47; Standardization</h6>
							  		<p>Having three different people wireframe using disparate design languages could result in the developers or UI designers misinterpreting our concepts; the ramifications of which, are obvious. To prevent any potential misinterpretations, I standardized Tori’s and Eric’s wireframes by using an iOS 9 design library and adhering to iOS design principles. </p>

						    		<p>In this final phase, we performed another round of user tests with our new high-fidelity prototype as well as an unanticipated paper prototype to validate our design solution.</p>
						    	</div>
						    	<div class="content--block">
							  		<h4>Listening to the Users &#47; Part 2</h4>
							  		<p>Since I wasn’t able to finish the student side of the prototype at the level of detail I desired by the time our scheduled student test subjects arrived, Tori and Eric quickly created a paper prototype simply by printing out their wireframes. We tested the tutors with the high-fidelity prototype.</p><p>Some of our findings are highlighted below. </p>

							  		<p>At this point, we presented our work to the clients one last time and provided a suggested path moving forward with considerations for post-alpha/beta release features as well as recommendations for the expansion of our work; and given the team only had three weeks with the client, I laid out a plan for implementing the feedback we received in the validation phase and adding the previously omitted user flows after parting ways with the client.</p><p>Overall, the client was highly satisfied with our work.</p>
